        <h3>About me</h3>

        <p>
        <div class="homepage-content">
        <p>I&rsquo;m a senior studying computer science at Stanford broadly interested in data-intensive systems in a variety of fields. In biomedicine, I currently work in the <a href="https://wanggroup.stanford.edu">Wang Group</a> on <a href="https://github.com/pboennig/DIMES">DIMES</a>, a project analyzing cancer scRNA expression data. During a quarter abroad in Madrid, I used CNNs to detect arrythymias as an intern at <a href="https://idoven.ai/?lang=en">Idoven</a>. I have also started working towards my master&rsquo;s degree in CS and I plan to graduate in 2022.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2019, I interned as a financial analyst for Matrix Capital Management in Palo Alto. This past summer, I was a software intern for Amazon&rsquo;s Supply Chain Optimization Team.</p>
